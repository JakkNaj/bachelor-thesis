# Theme System in Cross-Platform Development

The theme system implemented in this project addresses the challenge of maintaining design consistency across web and mobile platforms. It establishes a structured approach to design token management by mapping CSS variables to React Native values, creating a unified design language that can be consistently applied across different platforms.

## Implementation Approach

The system transforms web-based CSS variables into platform-agnostic JavaScript objects that can be consumed by both web and React Native components. This transformation process involves:

1. Converting CSS pixel values to React Native's density-independent pixel system
2. Mapping CSS color variables to React Native color values
3. Translating CSS typography units to React Native-compatible measurements
4. Adapting CSS spacing and layout concepts to React Native's flexbox-based layout system

## Core Components

The theme system is structured into several key modules:

1. **Color System**: Implements a semantic color palette with consistent naming conventions
2. **Typography System**: Manages font sizes, weights, and line heights across platforms
3. **Spacing System**: Provides a consistent spacing scale for layout and component spacing
4. **Component-Specific Values**: Defines standardized measurements for UI elements

## Technical Implementation

The system utilizes TypeScript for type safety and React's context API for theme distribution. Components consume the theme through a custom `createStyles` utility that ensures consistent styling application while maintaining type safety. This approach enables dynamic theme switching (e.g., light/dark modes) without requiring changes to component implementations.

## Benefits and Outcomes

This theme system significantly improves development efficiency by reducing the time spent on styling inconsistencies between platforms. It establishes a single source of truth for design tokens, ensuring that UI changes can be implemented once and consistently applied across all platforms. The system's type-safe approach also reduces runtime errors related to styling and improves developer experience through better IDE support.
